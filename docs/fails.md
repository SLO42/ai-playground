## F-014: live-verify hang + dev-server orphan storm
- **Date**: 2026-06-08
- **What**: A gap-closure build agent (v1.6/10.1) ran ~2h with no commit; it had built all files but spun forever on the mandatory live agent-browser verify, leaking 17 orphaned dev-server node processes.
- **Why**: agent-browser on Windows is flaky (os error 10060 read-timeouts; SurrealDB SDK hangs ~90s on a dead socket). The per-feature live-verify had NO time bound and NO server reuse/cleanup, so agents retry-spun and each re-booted (then leaked) a dev server.
- **Fix**: Hard commit gate = build+test+lint(0)+svelte-check(0). agent-browser smoke is REQUIRED-BUT-BOUNDED (~5 min, no spin) → on env timeout, record liveVerified:false + reason and proceed; consolidated live pass at the end-gate. Reuse ONE dev server; mandatory teardown of every spawned process.
- **Prevention**: In any workflow that live-verifies via a browser/dev-server: bound the browser step in wall-clock, never spin-retry a flaky tool, reuse a single server, and kill every process you spawn before returning.
